I was assumed to be Native American and a reporter. I was routinely stopped and asked additional questions about my background and travel plans. Sometimes they focused on my Mexican heritage, other times they focused on their assumption I was Native American. I was frequently asked questions that appeared to me were based on me being a young woman traveling alone who might be smuggling items or looking for under the table work. Whenever I came back to the US, I had an X on my face at ports of entry and had to go through additional revision. Even my travel partners were discouraged from staying with me and I felt Border Patrol attempted to isolate me from companions when I was not alone."
